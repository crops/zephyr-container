Zephyr Build Container
========================

> **Warning**
> This repository is now deprecated in favor of https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/docker-image

This repo is to create an image that is able to setup and use a Zephyr build environment.

The instructions will be slightly different depending on whether Linux, Windows or Mac is used. There are setup instructions for using **Windows/Mac** at https://github.com/crops/docker-win-mac-docs/wiki. When referring to **Windows/Mac** in the rest of the document, it is assumed the instructions at https://github.com/crops/docker-win-mac-docs/wiki were followed.

Running the container
---------------------
* **Create workdir or volume**
  * **Linux**

  The workdir you create will be used for all output from the Zephyr build
  system as well as where your workspace will be saved. You can either
  create a new directory or use an existing one.

  ```
  mkdir -p /home/myuser/workdir
  ```

  *It is important that you are the owner of the directory.* The owner of the
  directory is what determines the user id used inside the container. If you
  are not the owner of the directory, you may not have access to the files
  the container creates.

  For the rest of the instructions we'll assume the workdir chosen was
  `/home/myuser/workdir`.

* **Windows/Mac**

  On Windows or Mac a workdir isn't needed. Instead the volume called *myvolume* will be used. This volume should have been created when following the instructions at https://github.com/crops/docker-win-mac-docs/wiki.

* **The docker command**
  * **Linux**

  Assuming you used the *workdir* from above, the command
  to run a container for the first time would be:

  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v /home/myuser/workdir:/workdir crops/zephyr-container \
  --git "-b branch_name http://some/git/repo.git target_directory"
  ```

  * **Mac**

  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v myvolume:/workdir crops/zephyr-container \
  --git "-b branch_name http://some/git/repo.git target_directory"
  ```

  * **Windows**

  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v myvolume:/workdir crops/zephyr-container \
  --git "-b branch_name http://some/git/repo.git target_directory"
  ```

  Let's discuss some of the options:
  * **--git "-b branch_name http://some/git/repo.git target_directory"**:
    This is the url of the Zephyr OS git repo. The kernel source will be
    automatically downloaded and prepared to use inside of the
    target_directory.
    Substitute in the url, branche_name and target_directory for whatever
    Zephyr OS git repo, branch and directory you want to use.

  You should see output similar to the following:

  ```
  Attempting to clone -b master https://gerrit.zephyrproject.org/r/zephyr zephyr-src
  Cloning into 'zephyr-src'...
  remote: Counting objects: 10518, done
  remote: Finding sources: 100% (98219/98219)
  remote: Total 98219 (delta 62422), reused 98006 (delta 62422)
  Receiving objects: 100% (98219/98219), 39.75 MiB | 2.87 MiB/s, done.
  Resolving deltas: 100% (62422/62422), done.
  Checking connectivity... done.
  zephyruser@e6fc72513005:/workdir$

  ```
  At this point you should be able to use the shell to build Zephyr apps.

  Source the project environment file to set the project environtment
  variables:

  ```
  $ cd ./zephyr-src
  ```

  Source the project environment file to set the project environtment
  variables:

  ```
  $ source zephyr-env.sh
  ```

  Build the example project, enter:

  ```
  $ cd $ZEPHYR_BASE/samples/hello_world/

  $ make
  ```

* **Using a previous workdir**

  In the case where you have previously cloned the Zephyr git repo you will
  no longer need to specify the *--git* argument when starting the container.

  So the following command:
  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v /home/myuser/workdir:/workdir crops/zephyr-container
  ```
  on a previously setup workdir, should generate output similar to:
  ```
  zephyruser@a2968550e11d:/workdir$
  ```

Building the container image
----------------------------
If for some reason you want to build your own image rather than using the one
on dockerhub, then run the command below in the directory containing the
Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t crops/zephyr-container .
```

The argument to `-t` can be whatever you choose.
